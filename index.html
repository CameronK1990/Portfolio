  <h4>About Me</h4>
  <p>I love getting to know people and work with people that have difference outlooks. None of us will experience everything in our short time here but sharing our adventures is a way to explore life in a deeper way. I bring that into the work I do. Born and raised in Tampa, Florida I started my career after graduating with my Bachelors degree in Telveision production at 21 years old from Full Sail University in Orlando. I moved to New York City with four-hundred dollars in my pocket and survived for four years. I met so many amazing people that tought me how to be assertive, kind and humble. Surviving with a little help from my friends. While in New York I worked in casting for a commercial casting firm where we cast for major national and global companies for their marketing campaigns. I also cast for major telvision shows and worked as a freelance production assitant for major sports networks like ESPN. My IMDB can be found <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5339745/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">here</a>. After my stint in New York I moved back to Florida where I became a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vtlpgk0EKWM&t=3s">Field Representative for the Nielsen TV ratings.</a></p>
